The folders inside data_loaders are for data pre-processing and you should not need them for standard usage. 

The code that produces the datasets will use that code. 

Please, before producing the datasets (this should only need to happen once), make sure you are in the right conda enviroment, as some code
(e.g. LIDC-IDRI) requires a specific enviroment to be run.
