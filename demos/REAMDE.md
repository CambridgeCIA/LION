## The following demos are currently available:

1. `parameters.py` shows how to operate with AItools' parameter files. 
2. `train_LPD.py` teaches you how to format a training script, using Learned Primal Dual as example, with LUNA16 dataset
3. `ct_simulation.py` shows how to operate with CT tools, and simulate sinograms from images, and add noise. 
4. `LUNA16.py` shows how to use the classes that operate on the raw and pre-processed LUNA16 dataset.
