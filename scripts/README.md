# How to write a good script

WIP. Make template?

## Format:

1. Section explaning what the code does, in text. 1 Paragprah minimum. 
2. use `get_git_commit()` from `AItomotools.utils.utils` and print the commit hash in which you ran this code. Put it in the script in text. 
3. Write script/code. Please use as much commenting as possible. A 1/1 ratio of code/comments is desirable
