# EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

This folder contains a series of full example scripts. Tutorial-like demos will instead be in /demos folder. 
These scripts are full examples of using various algorithms. 

## LPD.py

This file showcases how to train the Learned Primal Dual algorithm using LION. 
You can however slightly modify this script (essenyially just change the model) to use any supervised training model.

## Noise2Inverse.py

This implements the Noise2Inverse self-supervised solver. it uses the MSD-net as in its original paper, but any other model should also work. 

## Equivariant imaging

Another self-supervised method. It uses the concept of euivariance to train a model.
