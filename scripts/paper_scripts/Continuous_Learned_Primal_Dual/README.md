**This is a work in progress folder, we are working on iterating on this work, which still is under review. The code here is not in its final form**

Scripts to reproduce the paper:

- cFBPConvNet does not work yet. 
- Scripts should be functional, but may have typos/issues, as merging them to the main branch lead to small changes. They should be correct in pseudocode, but we are working in cleaning them up.
